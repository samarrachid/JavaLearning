1-Write a program to print odd numbers that is not greater then 50, 
2-Write a program called Fibonacci to display the first 20 Fibonacci numbers F(n),
 where F(n)=F(n–1)+F(n–2) and F(1)=F(2)=1.
 Also compute their average. The output shall look like:
The first 20 Fibonacci numbers are:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765
The average is 885.5
3-Write a program called CozaLozaWoza which prints the numbers 1 to 110,
 11 numbers per line. The program shall print "Coza" in place of the numbers which are multiples of 3,
  "Loza" for multiples of 5, "Woza" for multiples of 7, 
  "CozaLoza" for multiples of 3 and 5,
   and so on. The output shall look like:
1 2 Coza 4 Loza Coza Woza 8 Coza Loza 11 
Coza 13 Woza CozaLoza 16 17 Coza 19 Loza CozaWoza 22 
23 Coza Loza 26 Coza Woza 29 CozaLoza 31 32 Coza
